Leaving So Soon is hastly written powermenu manly for personal use becuase rofi powermenu wasn't working. Took about 30 minitues so don't expect anything half decent. Also sorry for messy repo I'm 13 and I don't really know git and it's to boring to learn right know and none of my projects that a care about are even on here so...
